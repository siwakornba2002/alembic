# alembic3d

Python bindings (PyAlembic) for the [Alembic](https://github.com/alembic/alembic)
3D interchange format, packaged as pip-installable wheels under the name
**`alembic3d`** so they do not clash with the unrelated
[`alembic`](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/) database-migration tool.

```python
pip install alembic3d
```

```python
import alembic3d
from alembic3d.Abc import *
from alembic3d.AbcGeom import *
import imath          # PyImath, bundled inside the wheel
```

The import name is `alembic3d`; otherwise the API matches upstream PyAlembic
(`from alembic3d.Abc import ...`, `from alembic3d.AbcGeom import ...`).
